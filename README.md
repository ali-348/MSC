# MSc Data Science final project 

## Research Project Description
This research project focuses on investigating the applications of machine learning techniques in predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective is to develop accurate predictive models that can assess the risk of CVD based on various patient characteristics, medical history, and diagnostic measurements. This study explores different machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and feature selections methods to enhance the predictive performance and provide insights into the potential use of ML in clinical settings.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this research project contains anonymized patient data related to cardiovascular health, including various demographic information, medical history, and clinical measurements. Prior to model training, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling. Further details about the dataset can be found [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease].

## Results and Model Evaluation
The research project evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting cardiovascular disease, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. The models were assessed based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results and evaluation of each model are discussed in detail within the Jupyter Notebook, along with comparisons and insights derived from the analysis.

## Future Work and Improvements
This research project provides a foundation for further exploration and improvement in the field of cardiovascular disease prediction using machine learning. Potential avenues for future work include:
- Incorporating more advanced ML techniques, such as deep learning or ensemble methods, to enhance model performance.
- Exploring additional data sources or expanding the dataset to capture a wider range of patient characteristics and medical factors.
- Conducting more extensive feature selection / engineering to identify the most informative features for accurate prediction.
- Collaborating with medical professionals or researchers to validate the models and assess their practical utility in clinical settings.
- Investigating interpretability methods to gain insights into the factors driving the model's predictions and enhance transparency.
